# Soteria Lens - **Premium Feature**
product analytics tool, helps you make reports while analysing those analytics. In businesses analyse revenue per day/mnth/year; customer activity per cluster/segment (product, service, category). Analyse logs, such as error frequency, traffic, background service outcomes. Working with NoSQL data, meaning it's a "messy" document, we should normalize and make the data flow clear, what does this mean and what does it do. For UI, map out possible questions as templates (basic reports, revenue, traffic, gross volume) which helps set it up. Can be visual or text style. Our job is to make these logs fast to display and easy to read.

# Soteria Sensor - **Normal Feature**
tool, focuses on fraud detection, and makes a final compilation, determining how many payments were fraudulent (Fraud rate, Payment Fraud, Dispute Fraud, Prevented/Blocked Fraud, Actions Taken)
